# Deploying a Hugging Face Model to Amazon SageMaker

This tutorial will guide you through the process of deploying a Hugging Face model to Amazon SageMaker. By following these steps, you'll be able to host your model on a scalable and reliable platform.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

1. Create a SageMaker domain in the AWS Console.
2. Create an IAM account with SageMaker admin access and generate an access key.
3. Create an IAM role with SageMaker admin access.

## Setup

### Install AWS CLI

Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local machine. You can follow the official AWS documentation for installation instructions specific to your operating system.

### Configure AWS CLI

Run the following command in your terminal:

```
aws configure
```

Enter the access key created earlier and specify your AWS region when prompted.

## Deployment

1. Go to the Hugging Face website and find the model you want to deploy.
2. Click on the deploy button and copy the template code provided.
3. Open Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and create a new file.
4. Paste the template code from Hugging Face into the file.
5. Modify the role name in the code to match the IAM role you created earlier:

```python
role = iam.get_role(RoleName='PythonSDK')['Role']['Arn']
```

6. Save the file as `sagemaker_deploy.py`.
7. Run the `sagemaker_deploy.py` script to deploy your model to SageMaker.

## Verification

1. Open the SageMaker console in the AWS Management Console.
2. Verify that the model has been successfully deployed and the endpoint is active.

## Inference

1. Create a new file in VSCode and name it `sagemaker_infer.py`.
2. Write your inference code in the `sagemaker_infer.py` file to make predictions using the deployed model.
3. Run the `sagemaker_infer.py` script to perform inference.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a Hugging Face model to Amazon SageMaker. Feel free to explore and experiment with your deployed model.
